\title{Extract features from functional data.}
\usage{
extractFDAFeatures(obj, target = character(0L), feat.methods = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{[\code{Task} | \code{data.frame}]\cr
Task or data.frame to extract functional features from.
Must contain functional features as matrix columns.}

\item{target}{[\code{character}]\cr
Task target column. Only neccessary for data.frames
Default is \code{character(0)}.}

\item{feat.methods}{[\code{named list}]\cr
List of functional features along with the desired methods for each functional feature.
\dQuote{all} applies the \code{extratFDAFeatures} method to each
functional feature.
Names of \code{feat.methods} must match column names of functional features.
Available feature extraction methods are available under family \code{fda_featextractor}.
Default is \code{list()} which does nothing.}
}
\value{
[\code{list}]
  \item{data [\code{data.frame} | \code{Task}]}{Extracted features, returns a data.frame when
  given a data.frame and a Task when given a Task.}
  \item{desc [\code{extracFDAFeatDesc}]}{Description object. See description for details.}
}
\description{
Extract non-functional features from functional features using various methods.
The function \code{extractFDAFeatures} performs the extraction for all functional features
via the methods specified in \code{feat.methods} and transforms all mentioned functional
matrix features into regular data.frame columns.
Additionally, a \dQuote{\code{extractFDAFeatDesc}} object
which contains learned coefficients and other helpful data for
extraction during the predict-phase is returned. This can be used with
\code{\link{reextractFDAFeatures}} in order to extract features during the prediction phase.
